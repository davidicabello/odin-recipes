    <h1>Empanadas</h1>
    <img src="../images/empanadas.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>This is the best empandas recipe you will ever make!</h2>
    <p>There are as many variations of empanadas as there are cooks in Argentina (though they’re popular throughout
        Latin America, and Spain too). This version was developed by BA’s former test kitchen manager Gaby Melian, who
        is from Buenos Aires and was taught as a little girl by her mother and grandmother how to make them. She prefers
        these ones baked, not fried—and the puff pastry dough ensures you’ll still get all of those flaky layers. (If
        you prefer fried ones, try Gaby’s Ham, Cheese, and Onion Empanadas.)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over high. Cook beef, breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not
                completely cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much
                fat
                in pan as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce heat to medium and cook onion, bell peppers, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, stirring, until tender but
                not browned, 6–8 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Add cumin, paprika, oregano, and cayenne
                and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock and reserved beef along with any
                accumulated juices to pot. Stir in sugar, 4 tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. black pepper. Bring to a simmer and
                cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, until most of the liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes;
                taste and season with salt and black pepper, if needed. Stir in raisins. Transfer to a medium bowl,
                cover, and chill at least 3 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375°. Let dough sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. Remove 6 rounds from
                package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on a work surface. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the
                center of each round. Top with 2 olive halves. Brush water around half of outer edge of each round.
                Using plastic divider to help you, fold round over filling and pinch edges to seal. Using a fork, crimp
                edges. Remove plastic and transfer empanada to a parchment-lined sheet tray, spacing 1" apart. Repeat
                with remaining rounds (you’ll get about 12 empanadas on each tray).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly darker around the edges,
                25–35 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Filling can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Unbaked empanadas can be made
                3 months ahead;
                freeze on sheet tray, then transfer to freezer bags and keep frozen.</p>
