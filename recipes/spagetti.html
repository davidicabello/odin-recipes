    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until
                browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for
                about 1 minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of
                the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the
                sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the
                sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook Spaghetti</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then
            cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested
            cooking time.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To Finish</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a
            minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on
            top.
        </li>
    </ol>
